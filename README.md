# ExPath-reg
The code is designed for rigid image registration between two images. It can handle z stacks and generate 2D maximum intensity projection for image registration. This code doesnot handle 3D image registration.
This code has been tested on MatLab 2014b.
# Dependency
All the dependencies have been included.
# Installation guide
Download the code in a folder and put the folder path in the search path of Matlab. Unzip the helper.zip under the same folder.
# Expected output
A folder contains the registered images (multicolor channels are splited into individual single-channel images), all keypoints for registrations, matlab variables and a note with information such as expansion factor.
